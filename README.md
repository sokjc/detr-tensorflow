# Detection Transformer with TensorFlow
Prototype Implementation of Facebook's Detection Transformer (DETR) in TensorFlow with Efficient-Net backend

*Note:* This repository is purely experimential at this point. 

## High Level Goals
- TensorFlow.js makes in-browser deployment simpler
- Want to see if DETR can replace in-broswer objection detection algos out there
- EfficientNet could be more interesting CNN backend for DETR
